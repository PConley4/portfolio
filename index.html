    <h2> After getting my Bachlor's in Computer Science, I am now an aspiring programmer, with interests in backend and back end development. I also have knowledge
     of database management and Android app development, and like to do work on those as well. I prefer to use a variety of IDEs including:
     Android Studio and Eclipse for Java (my primary), Atom for C, VSC for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, and Workbench and MS Server for MySQL.
     I've also done work in MS Access using mainly Visual Basic and SQL. I know a variety of skills such as: Prototyping, Testing, Agile Methods,
     OOP/OOD, Virtualization, Task management software, and algorithmic thinking. Here, you can see some of the projects I have worked on. Some new, some old.
     If you would like to have a more in depth look, please check my github <a href ="https://github.com/PConley4" > here.</a> <br>
