  <h1>Android Math Quiz App</h1>

</head>
<body>
  <center>This is a Android App that I created for casual use using Android Studio.
    It utilizes Java, SQLite, and Android Studio and functions on both physical and virtual Android devices. 
    It generates five two operand equations and score is saved throughout shifting through activities.
    At the end, a final score is presented.
